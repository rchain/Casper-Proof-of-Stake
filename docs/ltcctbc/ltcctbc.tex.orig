\section{Background and Motivation}

i've had a lot of time to think this week because i’ve been waiting on
machines to synchronize with the blockchain. As a result, i’ve been
more motivated than ever to find a scalable and reliable architecture
for the blockchain. i believe i'm getting closer to a way to explain
and test a hypothesis that linear proofs provide the basis for a much
more scalable architecture for the blockchain. For background on what
i mean by linear proofs, here's a paper that interprets them in terms
of games, and here’s another that interprets them in terms of
traditional computational calculi like the lambda calculus.

A linear proof is a formal structure representing a proof of a formula
in linear logic.  The Curry-Howard isomorphism tells us that formulae
are types (as in data types in a programming language), and that
proofs are programs. This is a very broad and deep idea. In the 90’s,
for example, Abramsky extended it to proofs as processes, which Wadler
was only very recently able to realize as a correspondence between
linear proofs and π-calculus processes. In this context it means that
linear proofs provide a representation of both data (blocks) and
program (executable transactions) that gives several advantages over
the current choices made by the blockchain.

The blockchain is a great example of data that is also program; it’s a
giant ledger spread out over the Internet, that’s made of a bunch of
distributed, but interacting servers. To become more scalable, and
reliable, both ledger and servers will need certain characteristics of
data/program that have to do with a property called
compositionality. Scalability is always all about being able to build
composite systems from components. For example, if we can prove that
sections of the blockchain can be safely isolated from other sections,
for example, if all blocks necessary to prove that Alice has
sufficient funds to send M btc to Betty, can be isolated from the
blocks necessary to prove that Alfred has sufficient funds to send N
btc to Bob, then Alice and Betty, and Alfred and Bob can safely work
with projections of the blockchain, and thus complete their
transactions, not only in isolation of each other, but without the
onerous need to sync the entire blockchain.

One analogy is the use of separation logic (a child of linear logic)
to prove things about the structure of the heap which can, in turn, be
used to guarantee that two threads can operate at the same time
safely. The blockchain is like the heap. The Alice - Betty and Alfred
- Bob transactions are like the two threads. A proof that the heap is
of the form H1 * H2 together with a proof that T1 : H1 -> H1', T2 : H2
-> H2' constitutes a proof that T1 * T2 (thread T1 running
concurrently with T2) operate effectively in isolation and thus
safely. Likewise, a proof that the blockchain is of the form B1 * B2
(none of the transactions in B1 connect to addresses in B2 and vice
versa), together with a proof that AliceBettyTxn : B1 -> B1' (this txn
uses only addresses in B1), and AlfredBobTxn : B2 -> B2' (this txn
uses only addresses in B2) constitutes a proof that AliceBettyTxn *
AlfredBobTxn can operate with isolated projections of the blockchain.

If the blockchain is built using the primitives of linear logic, it
becomes easier and easier to construct these proofs, but also to
construct the blockchain, itself, in terms of smaller blockchains.

\section{Interpreting Linear Proofs as Operations on the Blockchain}
Here's the most basic interpretation.

\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule* {} {\vdash 1blkchnaddr : A \otimes \ldots \otimes A} %( with N occurrences of A )
\end{mathpar}

is a statement that there are $N$ $A$'s available at the address,
$1blkchnaddr$. $A$'s can be any resource, BTC's, AMP's, DogeCoin, etc.

\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule* {} {\vdash txn : A \otimes \ldots \otimes A \multimap B \otimes \ldots \otimes B %( with N occurrences of A in A * ... * A and M occurrences of B in B * ... * B )
\end{mathpar}

is a statement that $txn$ will generate $M$ $B$'s if provided $N$ $A$'s.

Terminologically, we say that $1blkchnaddr$ is a \emph{witness} or a
\emph{proof} of $A \otimes \ldots \otimes A$, and similarly, that $txn$
is a witness or proof of $A \otimes \ldots \otimes A \multimap B \otimes \ldots \otimes B$. Given two such
proofs we can use the cut rule of linear logic to produce a proof

\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule* {} {\vdash txn( 1blkchnaddr ) : B \otimes \ldots \otimes B}
\end{mathpar}

where $txn( 1blkchnaddr )$ is a new address in the blockchain
constructed from the information in txn together with
$1blkchnaddr$. This should look remarkably like function application,
because it is.

Notice that now we can see, recursively, what a proof of a statement like 

\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule* {} {\vdash 1blkchnaddr : A \otimes \ldots \otimes A}
\end{mathpar}

looks like. In most cases it will be a proof made from a previous
application of the cut rule.  This tree of cuts will trace all the way
back to some genesis block -- which is the only other way to have a
proof of a statement like

\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule* {} {\vdash 1blkchnaddr : A \otimes \ldots \otimes A}
\end{mathpar}

Now, where does the return address associated with $txn( 1blkchnaddr )$ come from?

To see this we have to look into the mechanics of $\multimap$ (called
linear implication or, more affectionately, lollipop).

\begin{equation*}
  A \multimap B = A^{\perp} \parr B
\end{equation*}

Linear implication is decomposed much like classical implication in
terms of a negation and a disjunctive connective. It is literally an
expression capturing the sentiment we need $A$ to get $B$, or $B$
comes with a cost of $A$. The use of a proof rule for these kinds of
links looks like

\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule* {\vdash G, 1blkchnaddr : A^{\perp}, 2blkchnaddr : B}{\vdash G, txn( 1blkchnaddr, 2blkchnaddr ) : A^{\perp} \parr B}
\end{mathpar}

where we snuck in the rest of the blockchain as $G$. As we saw above, $A^{\perp} \parr B = A \multimap B$; so, we can write

\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule* {\vdash G, 1blkchnaddr : A^{\perp}, 2blkchnaddr : B}{\vdash G, txn( 1blkchnaddr, 2blkchnaddr ) : A \multimap B}
\end{mathpar}

Now we see that forming a $txn$ comes with the requirement to provide an
address where $A$'s will be sent and an address where $B$'s will be
received. Expanding on these intuitions, we can see that the rules of
classical linear logic correspond exactly to a specification of
operations on the blockchain.

\subsection{Linear Sequents}

In more detail, a proof rule in linear logic is usually written in
terms of a transformation,

\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule* {S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_N} {S}
\end{mathpar}

taking \emph{sequent}s $S_1, \ldots, S_N$ to a \emph{sequent} $S$, where
a sequent is of the form

\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule* {} {\vdash G, t_1 : A_1, \ldots, t_N : A_N}
\end{mathpar}

A sequent is really just a statement about what is distributed where in an instance of the blockchain.

\begin{itemize}
  \item $t_1, \ldots, t_N$ are either addresses or programs that take addresses as input; they constitute the "focus" of the proof rule, or where the action is going to happen.
  \item $A_1, \ldots, A_N$ are (types built from) the different types of coin
  \item $G$ is the rest of the blockchain -- it is necessary to establish the distribution of resources we see at $t_1, \ldots, t_N$, but it's not the focus of the operation of the proof rule. 
\end{itemize}

Putting it all together, a proof rule of the form

\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule* {S_1} {S_2}
\end{mathpar}

is then a statement about how the blockchain in state $S_1$ goes to a
blockchain in state $S_2$. If you think about it, that's just what we
need to reason about transactions. In a transaction where Alice sends
Betty $N$ coin, we can think of the transaction as a rule that takes a
blockchain in a state where Alice has $N$ btc to a blockchain in a
state where Betty has $N$ btc.

\subsection{The Multiplicatives}
Linear logic, however, allows to build bigger blockchains from smaller
ones, and manages the dependency and information flow so that
everything remains consistent. Here's an example. The proof rule for
the tensor $A \otimes B$ looks like this

\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule* {\vdash G, t : A,  \vdash H, u : B}{\vdash G, H, t \otimes u : A \otimes B}
\end{mathpar}

It says that if you have one blockchain, $\vdash G, t : A$, and
another completely independent blockchain, with a totally separate
address space, $\vdash H, u : B$, then you can make a new one

\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule* {} {|- G, H, t \otimes u : A \otimes B}
\end{mathpar}

in which you just combine all the data of assignments of addresses to
resources in $G$ and $H$ in one big blockchain, $G,H$, and you can make a
kind of composite address (or program), $t \otimes u$, at which can be found
the combined $A \otimes B$ resource.

Now, comparison of the par ( $A \parr B$ ) rule, which establishes transaction links, is even more illuminating.

\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule* {\vdash G, t : A, u : B}{ G, t \parr u : A \parr B }
\end{mathpar}

This rule insists that the transaction link,  $t \parr u$, is made in the same piece of the blockchain, $G$.

The fragment of linear logic that includes, $A^{\perp}$, $A \otimes
B$, $A \parr B$, $A \multimap B$, is called the multiplicative
fragment of linear logic, or MLL. It talks about the basics of
transactions, loading up addresses with resources and establishing
dependencies between addresses, essentially recording transaction
history. However, it does so in a way that keeps track of how the
blockchain itself is segmented. This allows us to determine things
like how much of the blockchain do i have to see in order to safely
conduct this transaction, or can i conduct this transaction without
needing visibility into that region of the blockchain.

\subsection{The Additives}

Linear logic also enjoys another fragment, called the additives. This
aspect of the logic is all about conditionals and contingencies, this
or that, but not both. The linear logic connective called 'with', and
denoted $A \with B$, collects options together into a menu for subsequent
selection by interaction with choices indicated by the linear
connective 'plus', $A + B$. In symbols,

\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule* {\vdash G, t : A, u : B}{\vdash G, t \with u : A \with B}
\end{mathpar}

while 

\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule* {\vdash G, t : A}{ inl( t ) : A + B }
\end{mathpar}

and

\begin{mathpar}
  \inferrule* {G, u : B}{inr( u ) : A + B}
\end{mathpar}

If during a more complex transaction $t \with u$ gets tied to $inl( t'
)$, via $txn( t \with u, inl( t' ) )$, then this will reduce to a
transaction of the form $txn( t, t' )$. On the other hand, $txn( t
\with u, inr( u' ) )$ will reduce to a transaction of the form $txn(
u, u' )$.

\subsection{The Exponentials}

The fragment of linear logic that includes the multiplicative and
additive connectives is called MALL. The remaining connectives are
called the exponentials, $?A$, and $!A$. They denote copyable,
non-conserved resources. When we write $\vdash G, t : !A$, we are
saying that you can get as many $A$'s from the address (or program)
$t$ as you want. Thus, unlike currency, that address is linked to a
copyable resource like a document, or a jpeg, or audio file, or
... that can be shared widely. When we write $\vdash G, t : ?A$, we
are saying that you can put as many $A$'s into the address (or
program) $t$ as you want. You can think of it as a place to store
$A$'s, or discard them.

What’s critically important about the use of the exponentials is that
they mark resources that ought not to stay on the blockchain. They
indicate content and content types that can be better served by a
different kind of content delivery network. This is another important
function in helping with a scalable blockchain -- use blockchain
technology where it makes sense and use other means where it doesn’t.

Taken all together, we have an interpretation of full classical linear
logic in terms of operations on the blockchain.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

We have developed a view of full classical linear logic in terms of
operations against the blockchain. The view we have been developing
not only extends to provide a meaningful interpretation of full
classical linear logic to natural and intuitive operations on the
blockchain, it also extends and expands how we think about the
blockchain and what transactions on it are. Additionally, it provides
guarantees, mathematical certainties about the correctness of
transactions structured and executed this way. In particular, notice
that we focused mostly on the connectives governing $A$'s and $B$'s (the
resources to be found at addresses or programs). We didn't really talk
about the structure of $t$'s and $u$'s. These provide us with a simple and
intuitive syntax for transactions. Of equal importance, these
transactions are \emph{typed} programs. When we write $\vdash G, t : A$, we are
not only saying something about the resources produced or manipulated
by $t$, we are saying something about how t can be used, and in what
blockchain context we can expect t to perform correctly.

Understood this way, the blockchain interpretation gives new meaning
and perspective on some theorems from the linear logic literature. In
particular, it is well established that there is a natural notion of
execution of $t$'s. That is, when thought of as programs, we know how
to run them. When they are well typed, that is, if we have established
$\vdash t : A$, then $t$ is \emph{terminating}. That’s a theorem from
Abramsky’s computational interpretations of linear logic. What this
means for the blockchain is that proof terms and their linear
connectives provide a scripting language for transactions that, on the
one hand, provides termination for all well typed scripts, and on the
other is highly expressive. Further, if it turns out that this
scripting language is not expressive enough, then there is a natural
extension of proof terms via a correspondence between linear proof
terms and {$\pi$}-calculus processes that we mentioned at the top of these
notes.


\begin{tabular}{c|c}
  proof term & blockchain meaning \\
  address & address \\
  $t * u$ & isolated concurrent transactions \\
  $t # u$ & interacting or linked concurrent transactions \\
  $t \with u$ & menu of transaction options \\
  $inl( t ), inr( u )$ & transaction option selection \\
  $!t$ & copyable resource server \\
  $?t$ & copyable resource storage \\
  $txn( t, u )$ & joined transactions\\
\end{tabular}

This correspondence is not just useful for extending a scripting
language for blockchain transactions. It turns out the
{$\pi$}-calculus the premier formalism for specifying, reasoning
about, and executing protocols in distributed systems. Since one of
the real values of the blockchain is the fact that it is a distributed
means to conduct transactions, the need to tie this formalism to one
for specifying protocols in distributed systems is plain.

\subsection{Proof-of-work}

The glaring lacunae in this discussion is, of course, the relationship
to proof-of-work. Consider the following example. Suppose $C_1$ and $C_2$
are blockchains both of height $N$.

\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    C_1 = B_{1N} \leftarrow B_{1N-1} \leftarrow \ldots \leftarrow B_{10} \\
    C_2 = B_{2N} \leftarrow B_{2N-1} \leftarrow \ldots \leftarrow B_{20}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

We can define

\begin{equation*}
  C_1 \otimes C_2 = ( B_{1N} \otimes B_{2N} ) \leftarrow ( B_{1N-1} * B_{2N-1} ) \leftarrow \ldots \leftarrow ( B_{10} * B_{20} )
\end{equation*}

Note that it is insufficient merely to guarantee for $B \otimes B$’ that all
the transactions in $B$ are isolated from the transactions in $B$’. The
counterexample is

\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    C_1 = Block{ 1AliceAddr \rightarrow^{5btc} 1AllanAddr } \leftarrow Block{ 1BobAddr \rightarrow^{7btc} 1BettyAddr } \\
    C_2 = Block{ 1BobAddr \rightarrow^{7btc} 1BettyAddr } \leftarrow Block{ 1AliceAddr \rightarrow^{5btc} 1AllanAddr }
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

Clearly $B_{11}$ is isolated from $B_{21}$, and $B_{10}$ is isolated
from $B_{20}$; but, $B_{20}$ is not isolated from $B_{11}$, and
$B_{10}$ is not isolated from $B_{21}$. As a result, the spends in the
earlier blocks could impact the spends in the later blocks.

Instead, the entire address space of $C_1$ must be isolated from
$C_2$. In this case the network of servers, $N_1$, that maintain $C_1$ can
be safely combined with the network of servers, $N_2$, that maintain $C_2$,
and we can safely define the composite chain as above. The
proof-of-work protocol organizing $N_1$ is completely separate from that
in $N_2$. They do not interact. Yet, it is safe to combine the chains
using a glorified zip function. In this example,

\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned} 
    C_1 = Block{ 1AliceAddr \rightarrow^{5btc} 1AllanAddr } \leftarrow Block{ 2BobAddr \rightarrow^{7btc} 2BettyAddr }
    C2 = Block{ 1BobAddr \rightarrow^{7btc} 1BettyAddr } \leftarrow Block{ 2AliceAddr \rightarrow^{5btc} 2AllanAddr }
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

The address spaces of these chains are completely isolated (often
written $addresses( C_1 ) # addresses( C_2 )$ ). We are free to calculate

\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned} 
    C_1 \otimes C_2 \\
    & = \\
    Block{ 1AliceAddr \rightarrow^{5btc} 1AllanAddr } \otimes Block{ 1BobAddr \rightarrow^{7btc} 1BettyAddr }  \\
    & \leftarrow Block{ 2BobAddr \rightarrow^{7btc} 2BettyAddr } \otimes Block{ 2AliceAddr \rightarrow^{5btc} 2AllanAddr }
    & = \\
    Block{ 1AliceAddr \rightarrow^{5btc} 1AllanAddr ; 1BobAddr \rightarrow^{7btc} 1BettyAddr } \\
    & \leftarrow Block{ 2BobAddr \rightarrow^{7btc} 2BettyAddr ; 2AliceAddr \rightarrow^{5btc} 2AllanAddr }
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

The ordering of transactions provided by the two independently
executing proof-of-work protocols is combined in a completely safe.

Note that there are at least two possible interpretations of $C_1 *
C_2$. One is that the requirement is to verify that $addresses( C_1 ) #
addresses( C_2 )$. Another is to ensure this is the case by rewiring the
transactions. Under this latter interpretation even the counterexample
becomes safe

\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned} 
    C_1 \otimes C_2 \\
    & = \\
    Block{ 1AliceAddr \rightarrow^{5btc} 1AllanAddr } \otimes Block{ 1BobAddr \rightarrow^{7btc} 1BettyAddr } \\
    & <- Block{ 1BobAddr \rightarrow^{7btc} 01BettyAddr } * Block{ 1AliceAddr \rightarrow^{5btc} 11AllanAddr } \\
    & = \\
    Block{ 01AliceAddr \rightarrow^{5btc} 01AllanAddr ; 11BobAddr \rightarrow^{7btc} 11BettyAddr } \\
    & \leftarrow Block{ 01BobAddr \rightarrow^{7btc} 01BettyAddr ; 11AliceAddr \rightarrow^{5btc} 11AllanAddr }
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

There is much more to be said, but that must be left to a later revision!
